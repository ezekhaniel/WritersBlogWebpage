                    <p>Madeline Rosenlund is 18-years-old and has been a storyteller at heart for as long as she can remember. Sometimes, her fictional worlds seem more alive to her than the real one. One of the outlets she has found for her creativity is Counterculture for Christ, where she crafts words along with an amazing team of other young writers. Jesus Christ is her Lord and Savior, and she proudly calls herself a Daughter of the King. Besides writing, some of her other hobbies include reading, learning about history, and biking. She is honored to be a part of this community.</p>

                    <p>J.S.S. English has been writing for about four years. He writes mostly sci-fi and fantasy but has recently found his place as a writer for Counterculture for Christ, for which he writes in the Creative Writing, Culture/History, and Inspiration categories.

He has joined the blog to be a part of something fun and encourage people through his writing.</p>
