                    <p>Jadon G. Smith is seventeen years old and devoted to understanding the world God created, especially the abstract realm of thought and beliefs. 
                        His dedication to both writing for and guiding Counterculture for Christ has culminated in his role as both a writer and a director of the blog. 
                        After roughly a year of dedicating himself to seeking the greatest Truth, Jadon gave his life to Christ in November of 2022. 
                        Ever since then, his interests have consisted of learning about apologetics, theology, philosophy, psychology, and more. 
                        Other hobbies of his include texting friends, reading nonfiction, writing stories, teaching, going to youth group, watching documentaries, and playing Super Smash Bros Ultimate with his brother. 
                        One day he hopes to work as an apologist, helping others seek Truth wherever it may be, and doing so virtuously.</p>

                        Sometimes, her fictional worlds seem more alive to her than the real one. 
                        One of the outlets she has found for her creativity is Counterculture for Christ, where she crafts words along with an amazing team of other young writers. 
                        Jesus Christ is her Lord and Savior, and she proudly calls herself a Daughter of the King.

                    <p>Megan Kissling is a rather wild, adventurous, and imaginative 14 year old author in her last year of high school. 
                        She‚Äôs been writing for 3 and a half years, going from a terribly, handwritten, unedited 8k words to a recently published full length novel, ‚ÄòCursed Heir‚Äô. 
                        She is now writing in a plethora of genres and is nearly finished with two other book drafts!. 
                        She‚Äôs one of seven children, living on a 64 acre homestead in southern Missouri. 
                        She loves to play violin, read, write, and take part in whatever random outdoor activities the rest of her family is doing, and she hates onions, math, shoes and dresses. 
                        She‚Äôs been a believer since August of 2018 when she ended up getting mad at her siblings for interrupting her attempts to ask Jesus into her heart üòú
                        But since then she has grown in her faith and hopes to reflect the light of Christ in her writing. 
                        Her role in the Counterculture for Christ is to be a writer, editor, and whatever other occupation that needs help being filled and she can‚Äôt wait to see what God will do with this amazing opportunity to share, hope, encouragement, and faith alongside fellow authors like her!</p>
