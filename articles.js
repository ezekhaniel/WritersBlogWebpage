        title: 'Are you writing wrong?',
        summary: `<p><em><b>By Emma Dooley</b></em></p><p>I always heard that people write in specific ways. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You plot or you pants. Plotting being planning your story out. Step by step. Chapter by chapter. Pantsing following the saying of 'fly by the seat of your pants' or letting the story lead you from the beginning to the end with guideline to follow. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For years I didn't hear of anything in between. But I didn‚Äôt do either of those. I found studying different writing techniques to be wildly fascinating and yet, incredibly frustrating. It left me feeling like I wasn‚Äôt good enough. Like every word I wrote was a waste of my time and the time of anyone who ever tried reading it. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought I could never be a ‚Äòreal writer‚Äô if I didn‚Äôt start following the rules. I tried. I failed. I kept trying and kept failing. There was starting to be a part of me that wanted to give up. 
        I truly didn‚Äôt believe I could ever do it. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Somedays, the only thing that got me to put my pen to the page was that I knew God called me to write for a reason. His reason was never to make me feel like an outcast in the writing world. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I let go of trying to fit into the categories of plotter and pantser and I just wrote my way. But I still wanted to know what ‚Äúmy way‚Äù was. So, while I accepted that my way may be just that, I never stopped looking at the writing styles of others. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Learning to let go of my need to follow a certain standard, one I had put on myself, wasn‚Äôt easy. But it was worth it. It gave me the freedom to explore writing styles without constant pressure. It let me learn from everyone instead of just the ones who write like me. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It wasn‚Äôt until a couple years ago that I heard about ‚Äúwriting from the end‚Äù. I thought maybe that was the category I fell in. As I looked more into writing from the end, I found that it was very much how it sounds. You write the end of your book, and then the climax, and slowly work your way to the start. And that certainly wasn‚Äôt my style. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it made me realize what my style is. I like to call it inside out writing or puzzle writing. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I write scenes. Maybe I write the climax, then jump to the beginning. I move to the end, then come to the middle. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's not pure chaos in one document or scrambled up chicken scratch in some notebook. I keep it organized. Each scene gets its own labeled document or a fresh page in a notebook with a colorful label across the top. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does it feel a little crazy? Yes. Is it out of control? Maybe. But do I enjoy it? Absolutely. When I have enough scenes written out, I get to sort them all out. Like putting together puzzle pieces. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is this your writing style? Probably not. But my goal isn't to find your style, but to tell you you‚Äôre not alone. Writing isn‚Äôt black and white. It's not one way or another. Writing is whatever you make it. It doesn‚Äôt matter what your style is, you aren‚Äôt writing wrong. You‚Äôre just writing in the way that works for you. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don‚Äôt try to fit in someone else‚Äôs box when yours is perfect for you. Enjoy the process.</p>`

        title: 'Writing Process Overview!',
        summary: `<p><em><b>By Megan Kissling</b></em></p><p><p>Many times during my first two years of seriously writing I felt lost, utterly confused and completely idiotic whenever I sat down with my notebook and pen to start writing. I struggled to wrap my mind around forming workable plots, crafting good, relatable characters and even just the writing itself, like, my first partial draft (which I still haveüòñas a reminder of what NOT to do) was written half in first person and half in third person‚Ä¶don‚Äôt even ask how that happened. I have no answer for you other than I‚Äôve learned a lot since then. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But whenever I sat down to work on my writing I ended up stopping after just a few minutes in, fully stressed out just from thinking about how much I still had left and feeling ridiculous for the only three or four hundred words I was able to hand write every day. On top of that fact, my parents and family didn‚Äôt know I‚Äôd started writing and I never was able to take the time to research and learn how to properly write. I never thought about it at the time but a major part of my problem, aside from the obvious lack of narrative skill, my lack of writing skill and access to writing resources in general, and my families exclusion from my attempts, was that I had no outline or guide to help me keep track of everything I created and to help me realize that completing a chapter with a clear end goal in mind was actually getting me somewhere. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking about how much I had to do was‚Ä¶quite frankly, overwhelming. Like, there‚Äôs so much that goes into a story, how do you know where to even start?? Obviously I did not have any clue where to start as it took another year and a half before I finally managed to determine the difference between narratives and actually finish a full length novel draft and then publish it.ü´£ So, that is what I‚Äôm going to be providing here, an outline to help you do better at writing then I did when I first started. There is a lot to cover so for now I‚Äôll just do a brief overview, then over the next few weeks I‚Äôll go over each piece in depth. I hope you‚Äôre able to gather something from this, whether it just be encouragement that no matter how young you are it is possible to do great things. Philippians 4:13 ‚ÄúI can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.‚Äù Happy reading!</p>
                <h3>Inspiration/Idea</h3>
                <p>Every good book starts with a little bit of inspiration, an idea. Where a lot of new writers go wrong is thinking that you have to have a J. R. R. Tolkien level plot, complete with an entire language that you made up yourself. This, while absolutely astonishing if you‚Äôre just naturally the next J. R. R. Tolkien Junior and can come up with a complex storyworld without having a brain overload, is not true. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No story just comes to an author, themes, character arcs, plots and conflicts all wrapped up neatly in a little package and tied off with a green shiny ribbon. No, oftentimes it‚Äôs just a wisp of an idea, floating into your mind after listening to a song, watching a movie, or even just staring out the car window and observing how blue the sky is in that particular moment, and yes, I have done that before. Maybe it‚Äôs just a sentence, or a word. It sparks your interest, sets off explosions of excitement and slowly builds into something more. For instance, I was watching Ben-Hur with my family the other day and all of a sudden, during the most riveting, exciting part of the entire movie (the chariot race of courseüòú) inspiration for a gladiator type book struck. Actually to be specific I think it was right when one of the charioteers tried to run Ben-hur into the wall, my mind went ‚ÄúOooh, what if I had a character do that but actually succeed in running the other person into the wall.‚Äù ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èdon‚Äôt mind my slightly ruthless brain, it‚Äôs fine, I'm fine, I‚Äôm just an author not a serial killer. Alright, moving on, basically the point of what I just said was that your idea doesn‚Äôt have to be cultivated halfway to China, a simple idea can turn into an amazing story. Your story! </p>
                <h3>Preparation</h3>
                <p>Preparation is the next step to completing a novel. A lot of people are intimidated by the word because generally prepping stuff isn‚Äôt that fun, and takes forever, well, at least most of forever. But in reality, preparation is probably going to be one of the easiest parts of the entire writing process, so easy that there are some people who don‚Äôt even do it and just keep everything in their heads‚Ä¶kudos to you if your brain can handle all that and not forget anything, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I personally have to make a general outline of my story idea, characters, and storyworld or I‚Äôd start having some major problems. Preparation is basically just a lot of outlining: character outlines, overall story outlines, chapter outlines, story world outlines, making sure that I don‚Äôt go insane with how much stuff there is to keep track of outlines‚Ä¶you could make up an outline for literally anything. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know, that seems like a lot and you‚Äôre probably starting to feel overwhelmed. Don‚Äôt. It looks like a lot, it sounds like a lot, some of it may even be a lot, especially if you‚Äôre a perfectionist like me, but it also can be really simple, many of these outlines don‚Äôt even take that long, maybe fifteen minutes, and a few of them, depending on your story, aren‚Äôt even necessary, actually, technically none of them are necessary but for us people who have forgetful brains and need something to help us keep track of our billions of ideas, outlining is one of the most helpful things in the whole history of writing. Don‚Äôt stress about it! When I do another post, going into more detail about preparation, I‚Äôll hopefully have some free, downloadable outline sheets that I use regularly in my own writing to help you along a bit!</p>
                <h3>Drafting</h3>
                <p>Drafting is the next step to finishing a book. It's the part that everyone loves, as long as they have inspiration to write, and the part everyone dreads when writers block hits and all you want is to have your precious novel published and a physical copy with a beautiful cover in your hands. It's the easiest, yet hardest part of the whole process, and will produce the major portion of tears, stress, happiness, and excitement. Basically, it's the best. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drafting is where you write down your entire novel, without making any edits or revisions whatsoever, and don‚Äôt stop until every last word of that story you‚Äôve been longing to tell is in existence. This will take a lot of perseverance, consistency, effort and patience. Yes, you read it right, never thought you‚Äôd learn a virtue or two while writing, did you? I certainly didn‚Äôt. I learned it real fast though, as soon as a month passed of my first writing course and I still had nothing on paper because I‚Äôd not waited for my teacher's guidance and my chapters were absolutely unworthy of being read, so I ditched them. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I strongly recommend to anyone just starting out to go watch a few YouTube videos on writing, or just find a course to sign up for cause without that, I would have been completely lost. This doesn‚Äôt mean that if you‚Äôve never watched writing videos or read books about writing or even taken a course on writing that your book draft will be as awful as mine, but it saves so much time in revisions if you don‚Äôt just rush headlong into something and don‚Äôt have any patience to learn how it‚Äôs actually supposed to be done. </p>
                <h3>Revision/Editing</h3>
                <p>The next step is the revision and editing process, this for some people can be as difficult or more than drafting was. The main reason for that is because you‚Äôve just spent hours upon hours, days upon days, weeks upon weeks, I could keep going up but it‚Äôs starting to get old so hopefully you get the point- working on your book, your ‚Äúchild‚Äù as many of us authors call it and in revisions your ‚Äúchild‚Äù is going to change. A lot. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This isn‚Äôt true all the time, but more often than not, that‚Äôs just how it goes, maybe it‚Äôs because to fix a plot hole you have to add an entirely new character, somehow incorporate that new person into your MC's life and the events they go through. Maybe it‚Äôs taking out a scene because it just sounds like garbage, then when you start the rewrite the entire chapter then needs to be ditched because you had a genius new idea to add. The list continues. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People shy away from this because they spent all that time pouring their very souls into that ‚Äúchild‚Äù and they don‚Äôt want them to change. At all. Even if it‚Äôs for the better. It actually is genuinely sad and emotional for them to change it. I get it. It‚Äôs hard. I did NOT want to do it either, like, I‚Äôd spent five months writing the draft, why in the world would I change it???? Because no matter how good of a writer you are, every first draft needs to be revised, edited and changed. Not just to be changed, but to make it better. My book is better for it. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although, I‚Äôve still got a ways to go before it‚Äôll be anywhere near as good as some of my favorite authors. Your book will be better for it too! (Note: Editing and Revision are two different processes, Revision is usually the first set of changes you make to your book, the major ones where you fix plot holes, take out and add scenes. Editing is generally where you check for grammar and do line edits, smaller things like that.)</p>
                <h3>Publication/Marketing</h3>
                <p>This is what you‚Äôve been waiting for. Dreaming of. Your book. Published. A physical copy in your hand. Your name on the cover. You‚Äôve spent countless hours toiling over this masterpiece, persevering with undeterrable determination. And it‚Äôs finally done. First off, when you reach this point in your writing, you‚Äôd better celebrate. Buy some ice cream, cookies, or chocolate. Splurge a little. Pat yourself on the back and scream about it in all caps over chat to your best friend. ‚Ä¶don‚Äôt look at me like that, trust me, it‚Äôs normal, you‚Äôll understand how‚Ä¶freeing it is to go do that, especially when they yell back. And then email me so I can congratulate you on that achievement‚Ä¶in all caps.ü§≠ but seriously, that‚Äôs a big accomplishment. You should be proud. Because. You. Did. It. ü•≥ü•≥
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that you‚Äôve done all that celebrating it‚Äôs time to get serious. You may have finished your book, and gotten it published, but your work's not over. Thousands of books are published regularly, it won‚Äôt be long before your book is buried beneath how many others. It‚Äôs your job to keep that from happening. How, you may ask? Marketing. Build a blog, an Instagram account, a YouTube channel, even a simple newsletter. Make an effort to go to writers conferences, meet other authors, and spread the word about your book. Don‚Äôt be shy. To get your book out there, you have to get out there. 
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So there you are! A brief overview of the writing process! How do you feel? Excited? Slightly hesitant? Hopefully it's the former. I‚Äùll be diving deeper into each step soon so stick around to get more info! Thanks for reading!
