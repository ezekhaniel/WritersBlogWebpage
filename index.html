                <h1>Welcome to Counterculture for Christ!</h1>
                <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                <p>Out of all the reputations accumulated by specific age demographics, that of teenagers is both the most well-known and the most negative. 
                    Lazy, indecisive, unmotivated, and generally incapable of doing anything worthwhile, we’re just a burden to our parents and teachers till college whips us into shape. 
                    In a world already primed to overlook us, why should we bother trying anything great? 
                    Years ago, the question was asked by a few dedicated writers who wished to change this narrative, prove that teenagers can be more than screen-addicted leeches lurking in their parent’s basements. 
                    A conglomeration of books, blogs, websites, communities, group chats, and shared experience eventually brought together twelve young writers who took inspiration from those who dared to challenge the stereotype. 
                    An idea sent out one ordinary Thursday night, seconded with enthusiasm. 
                    Excitement catching like wildfire, bright and fierce, and a half dozen teens assembled by the next morning, eager and without a plan. 
                    In a giddy whirlwind of strategy and elation, roles were assigned and decisions were made, twelve teens and young adults making up the final group. 
                    By the time half the members joined a video call on Saturday morning to plan, a website was up, a name was in the works, and artists were at work on designs and logos. 
                    Somehow, out of millions of teens and thousands of young writers, the twelve of us came together and decided we were willing to work for difference. 
                    We would, with determination and gusto, bring about change, spreading—among other things—confidence in writing, the word of God, and community among teenagers and young adults. 
                    And if you’re reading this, maybe you can be a part of that change, too. 
                    See the plan God has for your life and act upon it, using your gifts for good. 
                    While you’re here, though? 
                    I hope our articles inspire and speak to you. 
                    That’s why we’re here.</p>
